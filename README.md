# Learn Arabic

I want to learn Arabic. This repo will help me do so. If I feel so inclined, I'll flesh this out and make it useful to other people.

## Notes

These are my preliminary notes. I'm going to read a variety of materials on the best ways to learn languages, and the best ways to learn Arabic. Once these notes are complete, I'll go through them and compile them into a list of concrete actions that must be taken. I'll try to think of milestones to create, and issues for each milestone. I'll create projects to put the issues into...to somehow keep myself accountable. The hard part is repeating tasks...figure out how to represent those.

- [ ] Start speaking from day 1
- [ ] Expose yourself to the language at every opportunity
- [ ] Do not be afraid to embarrass yourself
- [ ] Learn the most frequently used words first. Memorize them with flashcards
- [ ] Learn the cognates
- [ ] Consistently read the language (Read a little in The Book of Mormon every day, or a conference talk)
- [ ] Consistently listen to the language (Listen to General Conference or watch/listen to Al Jazeera live Arabic feed)
- [ ] Consistently speak the language
  - [ ] Tell short stories to yourself with new vocabulary words to remember them (mnemonics)
- [ ] Duolingo (once it supports Arabic for English speakers)
- [ ] Create SMART goals
- [ ] Deconstruct the grammar
