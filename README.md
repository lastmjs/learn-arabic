# Learn Arabic

I want to learn Arabic. This repo will help me do so. If I feel so inclined, I'll flesh this out and make it useful to other people.

## Notes

These are my preliminary notes. I'm going to read a variety of materials on the best ways to learn languages, and the best ways to learn Arabic. Once these notes are complete, I'll go through them and compile them into a list of concrete actions that must be taken. I'll try to think of milestones to create, and issues for each milestone. I'll create projects to put the issues into...to somehow keep myself accountable. The hard part is repeating tasks...figure out how to represent those.
